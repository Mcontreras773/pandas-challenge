Consistently, math and reading scores remain steady across grade levels when grouped by school. Math passing rates are consistently lower than reading, especially in lower-performing, larger, and higher-spending schools. The top 5 schools are charters, while the bottom 5 are districts. In general, bottom-performing schools spend more per student than top-performing schools. Schools with under 2000 students have higher passing rates than those with more students. This trend also applies to per-student spending and district vs. charter schools.
